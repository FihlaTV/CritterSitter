# Final Project working title: Critter Sitter

## Description
I love having pets in my life, but I also love the freedom to travel. I hated having to feel that you can do one or the other, but not both if you can't afford pet boarding. I want to help people who cannot travel with their pet to find a partner to take turns pet sitting so they can travel with peace of mind. 


Critter Sitter allows people to describe themselves and their pet menagerie and browse profiles to find a partner to exchange pet sitting favours with the added benefit of making new friends for humans and non-humans alike.
