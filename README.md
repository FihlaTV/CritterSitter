#Final Project working title: Critter Sitter

##Description
An app designed to help people with pets connect and find "swap mates". The idea is a sit-mine-sit-yours plan so that no money is exchanged. I watch your dog/turtle/bunny when you're gone; you watch my dog/bird/hamster when I'm gone. Barter only. Option for petless to participate, but the exchange would be a handmade/homemade gift, meal, favor, ... . Never money.
